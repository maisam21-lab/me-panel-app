# Safe updater for the ME Sales Panel app slot on data-apps.
# Run with: bash update.sh   (from inside the app folder, or by absolute path)
#
# Guards against the Jul 2026 incident where a force-checkout of one app's repo
# inside another app's folder replaced the kitchen tracker on Okta:
#   1. refuses to run if this folder's git remote is not the ME panel repo
#   2. refuses to touch anything if the folder is not a git repo at all
#   3. fast-forward only - never merges, never force-overwrites local state
